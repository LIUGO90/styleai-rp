# Engineering Design Document: Integrating Google Shopping Light API

## Objective

Replace the current mock search functionality with a real-time online search using the Google Shopping Light API. The goal is to enable users to find relevant product links and images online from US retailers.

## Overview

The Google Shopping Light API provides a streamlined way to access Google Shopping search results. This integration will allow our application to fetch real-time product data, including links and images, directly from Google Shopping US marketplace.

## System Architecture

### Current System

- **Mock Search**: Currently, the system uses a mock search that returns hardcoded product data.
- **Agent Interaction**: The agent selects a tool based on user input and returns mock data.

### Proposed System

- **Real API Integration**: Replace mock search with Google Shopping Light API calls.
- **US Market Focus**: Fixed geographic location to United States for consistent results.
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Maintain mock data as fallback when API is unavailable.
- **Enhanced Data**: Return real product links, images, prices, and ratings from US retailers.
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring API responses.

## Implementation Plan

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Core API Integration (COMPLETED)

1. **API Function Implementation**
   - ‚úÖ Created `searchGoogleShoppingLight()` function in `lib/chat-agent.ts`
   - ‚úÖ Added proper TypeScript interfaces for API response handling
   - ‚úÖ Implemented error handling and fallback mechanisms
   - ‚úÖ Updated response format to match actual Google Shopping Light API structure
   - ‚úÖ Fixed geographic location to US market (`gl=us`, `hl=en`)
   - ‚úÖ Added comprehensive logging for API response analysis

2. **Tool Integration**
   - ‚úÖ Updated `search_fashion_items` tool to use real API instead of mock data
   - ‚úÖ Maintained backward compatibility with existing tool interface
   - ‚úÖ Added comprehensive logging for debugging
   - ‚úÖ Optimized for performance by removing translation delays

3. **Response Processing**
   - ‚úÖ Transform API response to match expected format
   - ‚úÖ Handle both `shopping_results` and `inline_shopping_results`
   - ‚úÖ Extract product information (title, price, rating, thumbnail, etc.)
   - ‚úÖ Generate meaningful summaries focused on US market

### üîÑ Phase 2: Configuration & Setup (IN PROGRESS)

4. **Environment Configuration**
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **REQUIRED**: Add `SERPAPI_KEY` to your `.env.local` file
   - ‚úÖ Graceful fallback to mock data when API key is not configured
   - ‚úÖ Clear logging to indicate when using mock vs real data

5. **API Key Setup Instructions**:

   ```bash
   # 1. Sign up for SerpApi account at https://serpapi.com/
   # 2. Get your API key from the dashboard
   # 3. Add to your .env.local file:
   SERPAPI_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

### üìã Phase 3: Testing & Optimization (TODO)

6. **Testing**
   - [ ] Test API integration with various search queries (English and non-English)
   - [ ] Validate response format handling
   - [ ] Test error scenarios and fallbacks
   - [ ] Performance testing

7. **Optimization**

## Debugging & Logging

### Enhanced Logging Features

The implementation includes comprehensive logging to help understand API responses:

#### 1. **Request Logging**

```
[SearchAPI] Calling Google Shopping Light API for query: "macbook"
[SearchAPI] API URL: https://serpapi.com/search?engine=google_shopping_light&q=macbook&api_key=HIDDEN_API_KEY&hl=en&gl=us&num=10
[SearchAPI] HTTP Response Status: 200 OK
```

#### 2. **Response Structure Analysis**

```
=== GOOGLE SHOPPING API RESPONSE ANALYSIS ===
[SearchAPI] Full response keys: ['search_metadata', 'search_parameters', 'shopping_results', 'inline_shopping_results', 'filters']
[SearchAPI] Search Metadata: {
  id: "684c560337979a9d571be3fc",
  status: "Success",
  total_time_taken: 4.60,
  url: "https://www.google.com/search?q=macbook&..."
}
```

#### 3. **Results Analysis**

```
[SearchAPI] shopping_results found: 15 items
[SearchAPI] inline_shopping_results found: 8 items
[SearchAPI] Total combined results: 23
```

#### 4. **Individual Item Processing**

```
[SearchAPI] Processing result 1: {
  title: "Apple - MacBook Air 15-inch...",
  price: "$1,299.00",
  rating: 4.5,
  thumbnail: "present",
  link: "present",
  source: "Best Buy"
}
```

#### 5. **Final Output Summary**

```
[SearchAPI] Successfully processed 10 results from US market
[SearchAPI] Final items structure: [
  {
    id: "shopping-0",
    name: "Apple - MacBook Air 15-inch...",
    price: "$1,299.00",
    hasImage: true,
    hasLink: true
  }
]
```

#### 6. **Error Logging**

```
[SearchAPI] Error calling Google Shopping Light API: Error message
[SearchAPI] Error details: {
  message: "API request failed with status 401",
  stack: "Error stack trace..."
}
[SearchAPI] Falling back to mock data due to API error
```

### How to Use Logging for Debugging

1. **Check Console Output**: All logs are prefixed with `[SearchAPI]` for easy filtering
2. **API Key Issues**: Look for "SERPAPI_KEY not found" or HTTP 401 errors
3. **Empty Results**: Check if `shopping_results` and `inline_shopping_results` are found
4. **Data Structure**: Examine the "First item structure" logs to understand response format
5. **Processing Issues**: Monitor individual result processing logs

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed

- **US Market Results**: All results come from the US marketplace regardless of query language
- **Performance Optimized**: No translation delays, immediate API calls

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **No Results Returned**
   - Check logs for "shopping_results: NOT FOUND" and "inline_shopping_results: NOT FOUND"
   - Verify search query is not empty
   - Try different search terms

2. **API Key Issues**
   - Look for "SERPAPI_KEY not found" in logs
   - Check `.env.local` file configuration
   - Verify API key is valid on SerpApi dashboard

3. **HTTP Errors**
   - Check "HTTP Response Status" in logs
   - 401: Invalid API key
   - 429: Rate limit exceeded
   - 500: Server error (will fallback to mock data)

4. **Data Processing Issues**
   - Monitor "Processing result X" logs for individual item issues
   - Check "Final items structure" for output validation
   - Verify required fields are present in API response
