# 🚀 Major Update: AI Context & Image Compression System

## 📋 Summary

This commit implements a comprehensive solution for AI-generated image context management and intelligent image compression, resolving critical SSR issues and enhancing the chat experience.

## 🎯 Key Issues Resolved

### 1. **AI Generated Image Context Problem**

- **Issue**: AI-generated images were not being added to conversation context
- **Impact**: Users couldn't reference generated images with phrases like "the image above" or "this outfit"
- **Solution**: Implemented complete context management system

### 2. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Errors**

- **Issue**: `document is not defined` errors during SSR
- **Impact**: Application crashes on server-side rendering
- **Solution**: Implemented client-side detection and lazy loading

### 3. **Image Compression & Performance**

- **Issue**: Large image uploads causing slow performance
- **Impact**: Poor user experience with image uploads
- **Solution**: Smart compression system with multiple presets

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Core Features Added

#### 1. **Smart Image Compression System** (`lib/image-compression.ts`)

```typescript
- SmartImageCompressor class with format detection
- Multiple compression presets (chat, thumbnail, preview, generation)
- Client-side format support detection
- Automatic quality optimization
- SSR-safe lazy initialization
```

#### 2. **Enhanced Memory Management** (`lib/memory.ts`)

```typescript
- SmartContextManager for conversation history
- Image context tracking and retrieval
- Context relevance detection
- Automatic context pruning
```

#### 3. **AI Agent Context Integration** (`lib/chat-agent.ts`)

```typescript
- addGeneratedImageToContext() method
- Image analysis tool integration
- Context-aware agent selection
- Multi-turn conversation support
```

#### 4. **API Context Management** (`app/api/chat/simple/route.ts`)

```typescript
- Special action handling for generated images
- Session-based agent management
- Context synchronization endpoints
```

#### 5. **Frontend Context Handling** (`app/chat/page.tsx`)

```typescript
- Generated image context notification
- AgentInfo display for AI messages
- Image compression integration
- Enhanced debug logging
```

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Context Management

```
1. Generate an outfit image
2. Ask: "Can you add a tie to the image above?"
3. Expected: AI analyzes the generated image and provides suggestions
```

### Image Compression

```
1. Upload a large image (>10MB)
2. System automatically compresses to appropriate size
3. Maintains quality while reducing file size
```

### Agent Switching

```
1. Ask about colors → Color expert (彩虹)
2. Ask about occasions → Occasion expert (场合)
3. Ask about styling → Style expert (小雅)
```
